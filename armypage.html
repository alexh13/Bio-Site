                <h2>Phase One</h2>
                <p class="main-text"> 
                    Shortly after graduating High School I enlisted in the United States Army. I shipped off from home October of 2012 and arrived at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, to begin Basic Training. The gas chamber was by far the wildest experience I had. We were given gas masks to put on and told to walk into a barn. Once inside the Drill Sergeants sealed the doors and began releasing Tear Gas. After several minutes we were told to remove our masks and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. Needless to say nobody made it very far before we were all on the crowd coughing and choking. It was great!

                <h3>Phase Two</h3>
                <p class="first-text">
                    After Graduating Basic Training, I was sent to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. This phase was called AIT (Advanced Infantry Training) where I spent the next 6 weeks honing the skills needed to perform my job to the Army Standard. The third and final phase of my training: Airborne School. Where I was trained to jump out of a perfectly good aircraft. Fun fact - I am terrified of heights! This was a two week course, at the end of it we had to run five miles in forty minutes and jump out of a plane five times. Three times during the day, twice at night. Graduating this school I earned the coveted "jump" wings and the right to wear the Maroon Beret, like my grandfather before me.

                <h4>Phase Three</h4>
                <p class="second-text">
                   Completing Airborne School I was assigned my first duty station: Alaska. What a change of weather it was from living in California my whole life. I spent the next four years stationed there. Besides being cold 90% of the time, I was had experienced unique events that have left me with amazing memories. I wouldn't be who I am today with out the brothers and sisters I served with, Life-long friends. I'll never forget jumping out of an airplane in negative temperatures and that feeling of finally hitting the soft snow looking up at the Northern Lights. Or the ear-shattering sounds of a Howitzers being fired in total darkness. The five or more runs in freezing temperatures. Those experiences are truly unique, and will stay with me forever.

                <p class="main-text"> 
                    Hello! Welcome to my home page. My name is Alex. I'm 25 years old and currently going to school at City College of San Francisco. I'm a Sophomore majoring in Computer Science. I have experience with Python, my primary language of choice, and recently took up HTML5 and CSS. Looking forward to learning C++ this coming Spring Semester. Prior to signing up for College I spent four years in the United States Army. After I finished my enlistment, I returned home and joined a Union Hall out of Martinez and spent the next year working in the construction industry. I did that for about a year and a half and decided to return to school and pursue a degree in Computer Science. I made a few buttons at the bottom of the page - click on one to learn more about those experiences.

                    My weekly affairs generally involve exercising at gym, school work and creating/learning more software development. This world of computer's and languages was a passion I never knew I had until mid 2018. Ever since I started learning Python I can't stop myself from learning more and seeing what programs I can create.

                    When the weekends come around I continue with school work and if that’s finished I spend the remaining time going on adventures with my two Huskies, Jax and Luna.
